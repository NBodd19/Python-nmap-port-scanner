# Python-nmap-port-scanner
This is a very basic port scanner script made with Python. The nmap module is required to run it. The user inputs a website URL and the desired ports, as inputted by the user, are scanned. The output shows the open ports in the format of the port number followed by whether or not it's filtered, the service, the version, etc.

It should be noted that this code should be used strictly for educational purposes. Many legal issues can come with port scanning, so only scan websites that give explicit permission.
